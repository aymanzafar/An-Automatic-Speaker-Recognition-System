## Digital Signal Processing Project:

# 🎙️ An Automatic Speaker Recognition System

This project presents a complete pipeline for **Automatic Speaker Recognition** using **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)** and **Vector Quantization (VQ)**. Developed as part of the **Digital Signal Processing Laboratory** at United International University (Fall 2022), this system distinguishes and verifies speakers based on their vocal characteristics.
